# Presentation at Morton High School

This is the class presentation for Morton High School in Morton, IL where I taught in the 
math department for many years before moving to industry. I am speaking to the honors math 
classes about data science and relating back to some concepts they would encounter in 
Pre-Calculus, Statistics, Algebra II, etc.
